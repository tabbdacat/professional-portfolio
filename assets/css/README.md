# Professional Portfolio Website

## Description

This website showcases my professional projects in Web Development. The application is responsive to screen size, includes a brief biography of myself including my experience and strengths, contains photos with working links to deployed projects, and also has contact information with several contact methods listed. 

The application is made to be visually appealing and interactive, with color schemes condensed to variables, box sizes and display adjustable to screen size, and visual changes when the user hovers over links and project images. The site is also meant to be accessible for those with screen readers and developed with SEO in mind.

The HTML document and CSS sheets were organized and logical in structure. Several CSS stylesheets were used. A reset stylesheet was used to reset browser settings, and a variables stylesheet was used to eliminate duplication of code and provide an simpler way to alter colors/display when anticipated. Best practices for file structure and naming conventions were followed.

While developing this website, I learned a lot about not only developing the initial code that goes into HTML and CSS, but I also learned about a lot of extra add-ins to make websites more interactive for users.

## Usage

Once viewing the website, you can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). You can view different sections of HTML, which includes comments to ensure it is easy to understand how each section is displayed on the application. The CSS stylesheet is organized to be efficient and easy to read, also including comments regarding how each selector interacts with HTML.
